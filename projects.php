				<h2>Flushing Chamber of Commerce</h2>
				<p>
					An important part of the economy of Flushing is restaurants. Flushing was primarily settled by Taiwanese and other Mandarin speaking Chinese immigrants. 
					This is the cuisine for which the neighborhood is most well known. 
					There are additional communities of Irish, Greek, Russian, and Italian communities, as well as communities of Indians, Sri Lankans, Malaysians, and Hispanics, mostly Colombians and Salvadorans.
					We are compiling a map of the restaurants of these various ethnic groups.

				<h2>Building Research</h2>
				<p>
					In partnership with the building performance lab at the CUNY School of Professional Studies and the CUNY Institute of Software Design and Development the Queens Incubator 
					is applying machine learning to the prediction of tempratures and energy consumption of large buildings. 
					Every year, New York City Government (and its residents) spend literally billions of dollars to heat and cool their living and work space. 
					Sadly much of that spending is wasteful with buildings being heated and cooled at the same time. 
					Our project hopes to guide New York City agencies on how to make their workspace more comfortable in an energy efficient manner.
