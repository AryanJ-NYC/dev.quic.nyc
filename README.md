###Running the demo

The website is served through PHP, so "php -S localhost:5000" will be enough to view the website on your local browser. Use Chrome for best results!

If you can't run the demo for some reason, you *should* be able to view a live demo [here](http://kevinramsunder.com/new/).

Also, the contact forms on the [live demo](http://kevinramsunder.com/new/) are live so feel free to test them out. The email will be sent to me (will redirect to admin later).

###Issues

overall: come to a consensus on color schemes, logo design, content/page layout, **images**, etc.

about.php: Could use some images of queens college, facilities etc. 

about.php: Perhaps add what we can offer potential clients.

contact.php: Still in development, will add this soon.

**about.php:** Need more information (~one paragraph) for the About Us - The Queens College Incubator section.

about.php: Need more information about our facilities such as our building and our **anticipated server space**.

**staff.php:** add the fellows/interns, I only have Dr. Brown at the moment, *work on images later*.

**footer.php:** The facebook link does not work, the page does not exist. Either create facebook or delete link.

**footer.php:** the text widget needs to be filled in with some sort of information.

apply.php: radio buttons look a little weird. 

footer.php: get the copyright year dynamically using PHP.

contact.php & signup.php: add phone number 

footer.php: add a phone number (or just remove the field for it)

signup.php: I would like the user to see a page of what we can offer them before they get to the sign up form, but first we need a *complete* list of what we can actually offer them (server space, housing, *add more*)

**success.php:** need to create a success page after form submission. There is currently a placeholder in the main directory.
