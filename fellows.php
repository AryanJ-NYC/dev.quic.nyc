                <h3>Matthew Blanco</h3>
                <p>I am currently a senior at Queens College pursuing my Bachelor’s in Computer Science. I am lucky to have had     
                family and friends who have given me courage when I thought I had none. Simply not wanting to disappoint these people        
                whose favorable opinions I care so much about has increased my motivation and eventually my own confidence. This has     
                developed into a will to keep fighting and always trying my hardest to accomplish any task at hand.</p>      
                <p>Because I have been so lucky to have this network, the community as much as my academic goals have been the focus     
                of my work. Service has been at the heart of what I do for the better part of my High School and Collegiate      
                experience. My volunteer experience includes after school child care and tutoring in the Hell’s Kitchen community.       
                I spent three hours a day with children who would otherwise have had nowhere to go after school, allowing them to        
                study, do homework, and have a safe place within the community they could come together to be children for a few     
                hours a night.</p>       
                <p>I also participated in Habitat for Humanity service trips. I was and have been a huge proponent of the work done      
                by Habitat for Humanity. Over the course of two service trips, I spent two weeks in Bayou La Batre, Alabama restoring        
                the home of a family devastated by Hurricane Katrina and two weeks in the Appalachia Region of Tennessee constructing        
                a new home for a family who never never had the chance to own one before. The time spent in these communities and        
                with those on these trips has given me the empathic foundation with which I live my life everyday. Along with my     
                volunteer service I spent time collecting and fundraising for the Atlanta Community Food Bank to support the less        
                fortunate in the community.</p>

                <h3>Carlos Del Rosario</h3>
                <p>Born and raised in the Dominican Republic, I moved to the United States in September of 2010. I am currently a Senior at Queens College; Originally pursuing a degree in Telecommunications Engineering I decided to get into the Computer Science field. Technology and Computers have always been of my interest; I enjoy learning new things and creating something from nothing. Programming has been something I've enjoyed since the day I wrote my first line of code. This is why participating in the Queens College Incubator to help create things that can benefit society while at the same time give experience and teach me new thing is a really great opportunity. In my spare time I enjoy learning about new technologies and work on small projects. Among technologies that call my attention right now are Software Development, Android Applications, Arduino Projects, 3D Printing and more.</p>

                <h3>Kenneth Goodman</h3>
                <p>I am an Applied Mathematics Student with a concentration in Computer Science at Queens College. On my free time I study data analytics, number theory and video game design. At the Queens College incubator, my principal focus is on the STEM+C project. I hope to help improve learning in the fields related to STEM+C and to help students from various backgrounds succeed in fields that are so important.</p>

                <h3>Aryan Jabbari</h3>
                <p>I am a graduate student at CUNY Queens College and an IT aide at Queens College's Academic Advising Center. In addition to learning at Queens College, I am an active student at Coursera and regularly take computer science courses online. I am interested in using technology to help others, especially those in Queens county. My principal focuses at the Queens College technology incubator is on the Starter Jobs and Flushing Chamber of Commerce projects.</p>

                <h3>Kevin Ramsunder</h3>
                <p>I am a third year undergraduate student at Queens College. I started programming as a hobby in high school after participating in my school's Robotics program. Today, my main goal in this field is to use technology to improve every aspect of our daily lives. Aside from my own personal projects, I enjoy coding collaboratively with others who share the same passion for creating useful and innovative software. I am also a believer in the Open-Source movement and its mission to make software free for the community.</p>           
                
                <h3>Miriam Striks</h3>
                <p>I am a senior majoring in computer science at Queens College, where I also work with Professor Christopher Hanusa  doing research in experimental mathematics. As part of our research, I recently developed a program that yields  meaningful data for combinatorics research. I have previously worked at Tax Credit Co., a tax credit consultancy based in Los Angeles, where I created an internal credit tracking template that resulted in enhanced credit  management for Fortune 500 clients.</p>
