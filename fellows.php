              <p>Born and raised in the Dominican Republic, I moved to the United States in September of 2010. I am currently a
              Senior at Queens College; Originally pursuing a degree in Telecommunications Engineering I decided to get into the
              Computer Science field. Technology and Computers have always been of my interest; I enjoy learning new things and
              creating something from nothing. Programming has been something I&#39;ve enjoyed since the day I wrote my first line
              of code. This is why participating in the Queens College Incubator to help create things that can benefit society
              while at the same time give experience and teach me new thing is a really great opportunity. In my spare time I enjoy
              learning about new technologies and work on small projects. Among technologies that call my attention right now are
              Software Development, Android Applications, Arduino Projects, 3D Printing and more.</p>

              <p>I am currently a senior at Queens College pursuing my Bachelor’s in Computer Science. I am lucky to have had
              family and friends who have given me courage when I thought I had none. Simply not wanting to disappoint these people
              whose favorable opinions I care so much about has increased my motivation and eventually my own confidence. This has
              developed into a will to keep fighting and always trying my hardest to accomplish any task at hand.</p>
              <p>Because I have been so lucky to have this network, the community as much as my academic goals have been the focus
              of my work. Service has been at the heart of what I do for the better part of my High School and Collegiate
              experience. My volunteer experience includes after school child care and tutoring in the Hell’s Kitchen community.
              I spent three hours a day with children who would otherwise have had nowhere to go after school, allowing them to
              study, do homework, and have a safe place within the community they could come together to be children for a few
              hours a night.</p>
              <p>I also participated in Habitat for Humanity service trips. I was and have been a huge proponent of the work done
              by Habitat for Humanity. Over the course of two service trips, I spent two weeks in Bayou La Batre, Alabama restoring
              the home of a family devastated by Hurricane Katrina and two weeks in the Appalachia Region of Tennessee constructing
              a new home for a family who never never had the chance to own one before. The time spent in these communities and
              with those on these trips has given me the empathic foundation with which I live my life everyday. Along with my
              volunteer service I spent time collecting and fundraising for the Atlanta Community Food Bank to support the less
              fortunate in the community. My personal website is

              <p>I am an Applied Mathematics Student with a concentration in Computer Science at Queens College. On my free time I
              study data analytics, number theory and video game design. At the Queens College incubator, my principal focus is on
              the STEM+C project. I hope to help improve learning in the fields related to STEM+C and to help students from various
              backgrounds succeed in fields that are so important.</p>

              <p>My name is Kevin Ramsunder, and I am a third year undergraduate student at Queens College. I started programming
              as a hobby in high school after participating in my school&#39;s Robotics program. Nowadays, my main goal in this
              field is to use technology to improve every aspect of our daily lives. Aside from my own personal projects, I enjoy
              coding collaboratively with others who share the same passion for creating useful and innovative software. I am also
              a believer in the Open-Source movement and its mission to make software free for the community. At the Queens College
              Incubator, I am interested in the Starter Jobs task in hopes that the project will have a real world impact for
              people who are having trouble finding jobs. My resume is available here. My website is KevinRamsunder.com.</p>

              <p>I am a senior majoring in computer science at Queens College, where I also work with Professor Christopher Hanusa
              doing research in experimental mathematics. As part of our research, I recently developed a program that yields
              meaningful data for combinatorics research. I have previously worked at Tax Credit Co., a tax credit consultancy
              based in Los Angeles, where I created an internal credit tracking template that resulted in enhanced credit
              management for Fortune 500 clients. I look forward to contributing to projects at the Queens College incubator,
              particularly the Starter Jobs project.</p>
